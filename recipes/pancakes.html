    <title>Norwegian Pancakes</title>

    <h1>Norwegian Pancakes</h1>

    <h2>
      My Norwegian grandmother made this for us as a treat, and it continues to
      be a favorite my mother makes for my kids. Very easy and versatile. Serve
      rolled like a crepe with syrup or jam. Can also be a dessert stuffed with
      a sweetened cream cheese and lingon berry mixture.

    <h3>Ingredients Checklist</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 eggs</li>

      <li>1 1/2 cups of milk</li>

      <li>1 cup of all-purpose flour</li>

      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine the eggs and milk in the container of a blender. Add the flour,
        salt and sugar, and blend until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a skillet over medium-high heat, and coat with cooking spray or
        butter. Scoop about 1/4 cup of batter into the skillet, and tilt the pan
        to coat the bottom. Cook until the top looks dry, about 30 seconds.
        Carefully slide a spatula under the pancake and flip. Cook for a few
        seconds on the other side, just until browned. Remove to a plate, and
        repeat with remaining batter.
